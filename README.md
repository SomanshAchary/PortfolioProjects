Title: "Sales Analysis and Insights: Maximizing Revenue and Understanding Customer Behavior"

Project Summary:

In this project, we conducted a thorough analysis of sales data to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the business.
The project involved several key steps:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
   - I imported necessary libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
   - Merged data from multiple monthly CSV files into a single DataFrame for analysis.
   - Removed rows with missing data.

2. Data Augmentation:
   - I enhanced the dataset by adding additional columns, such as the month, city, hour, and minute, to facilitate deeper analysis.
   
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Question 1: Determining the best month for sales and the revenue earned during that month. 
                 This analysis provided insights into seasonal sales patterns.

   - Question 2: Identifying the city that sold the most products, shedding light on geographical sales trends.
   
   - Question 3: Determining the optimal time for displaying advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products.
                 I analyzed hourly order patterns to make informed marketing decisions.
   
   - Question 4: Identifying the product that sold the most and exploring its relationship with price. 
                 This analysis helped understand the top-performing product's success factors.
   
4. Data Visualization:
   - I visualized the results of my analysis using bar charts and line charts, making the findings more accessible and actionable.

5. Insights and Recommendations:
   - Based on the analysis, I provided recommendations to the business:
      - The best month for sales is December followed by octer, with total revenue of $ 4613443.
