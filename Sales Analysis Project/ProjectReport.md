**Title: "Sales Analysis and Insights: Maximizing Revenue and Understanding Customer Behavior"**

**Project Summary:**

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of sales data to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the business.
The project involved several key steps:

**1. Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - I imported necessary libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
   - Merged data from multiple monthly CSV files into a single DataFrame for analysis.
   - Removed rows with missing data.

**2. Data Augmentation:**
   - I enhanced the dataset by adding additional columns, such as the month, city, hour, and minute, to facilitate deeper analysis.
   
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Question 1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month? 
   - Determining the best month for sales and the revenue earned during that month. 
     This analysis provided insights into seasonal sales patterns.

   - Question 2: What city sold the most product?
   - Identifying the city that sold the most products, shedding light on geographical sales trends.
   
   - Question 3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
   - Determining the optimal time for displaying advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products.
     I analyzed hourly order patterns to make informed marketing decisions.
   
   - Question 4: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
   - Identifying the product that sold the most and exploring its relationship with price. 
                 This analysis helped understand the top-performing product's success factors.
   
**4. Data Visualization:**
   - I visualized the results of my analysis using bar charts and line charts, making the findings more accessible and actionable.

**5. Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Based on the analysis, I provided recommendations to the business:
      - The best month for sales is December followed by octer, with total revenue of $4,613,443 and $3,736,726 respectively.
      - The city of San Francisco (CA) has consistently outperformed others in sales.
      - To maximize customer engagement, consider advertising during the hours slightly before 7pm  or between 11am - 12 noon.
      - The top-selling product is AAA Batteries (4-pack), with 31017 units sold and an average price of $2.99.
          The price of this product positively influences its sales.

**This project equips the business with data-driven insights to make informed decisions,
allocate resources effectively, and optimize sales strategies for future success.**
